# Operations Research - Algorithm Visualizers

An interactive educational platform designed to help students, researchers, and practitioners master optimization algorithms through step-by-step visualizations.

## Overview

Operations Research (OR) involves applying advanced analytical methods to make better decisions. This tool provides a visual and interactive way to understand complex algorithms used in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and optimization.

## Key Features

- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Watch algorithms unfold iteration by iteration with clear explanations for each transition.
- **Interactive Input**: Input your own problem data and see how the algorithms handle different scenarios.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed specifically for learning, highlighting critical concepts in linear programming, dynamic programming, and network optimization.
- **Modern Interface**: A clean, responsive design with support for both light and dark themes.

## Supported Algorithm Visualizers

The platform currently includes implementations for the following optimization problems:

1.  **Simplex Method**: Visualizing the iterative process of solving linear programming problems.
2.  **Graphical Method**: Geometric interpretation of two-variable linear programming.
3.  **Transportation Problem**: Methods for finding optimal distribution strategies (e.g., North-West Corner, Vogel's Approximation).
4.  **Assignment Problem**: Solving the task allocation problem efficiently.
5.  **Knapsack Problem**: Exploring dynamic programming approaches to resource optimization.
6.  **Shortest Path**: Visualizing network optimization and pathfinding algorithms.
7.  **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**: Understanding combinatorial optimization and heuristic approaches.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern layout and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core algorithm logic and DOM manipulation.
- **SVG/Canvas**: For graphical representations and network visualizations.
